          <h3>Your Turn Management App</h3>
          <p>Your Turn is a revolutionary management app created for university apartment turnovers created to become the only needed digital clipboard for the short term fast paced process.

            <h3>Preheat Recipe App</h3>
            <p>Preheat was created from the researched necessity of real world busy moms to have a recipe app with only meals that can be prepared in the time it takes the oven to preheat. Empathetically designed with time saving app features like actual cook time, no blog posts or scrolling, cook mode, social engagement, real ratings and reviews, and grocery cart functionality with self-shopping stores like Walmart.

            <h3>Melissa June Website Redesign</h3>
            <p>Melissa June is a website redesign project for a local gourmet caramel apple business which had grown exponentially and was not serving online customers or the owner anymore. Unable to satisfy customer needs, the website was revised to include product images, prices, and descriptions, cart and payment functionality, as well as an about me section and customer service information.
